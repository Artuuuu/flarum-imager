        Here you can set the maximum image size.
        In the case of a logo, the size is the image height.

        If the uploaded image is less than or equal to the default flarum values, the extension will not create a second image.
        If the image is smaller than the maximum size, it will not be changed.
        When an image is larger than you set, it will be reduced to its maximum size.
        However, if the favicon has the .ico extension, the plugin does not create a second file or resize the image.

        In the permission settings you can set which user group can upload a larger avatar than the default flarum settings.

      favicon_size: Favicon size {input} pixels.
      logo_size: Logo size {input} pixels.
      avatars_size: Avatars size {input} px.
      delete_files: Delete imager files
      disposal:
        avatars: All avatars
        logo: Delete logo
        favicon: Delete Favicon
        all: Everything
      success: Success

    permissions:
      resized_avatar: Allow avatars resizing
